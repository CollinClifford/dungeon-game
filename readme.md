# Dungeon of Doom

This is going to be an easy and fun text based game.

The user will be able to travel through a **castle** at night and find _items_ and fight _monsters_.

Items will be stored in the `state = {}` and monsters in the `monsters = {}`.

The journey will go as following:
1. start in the woods.
2. enter the castle.
3. go through multiple levels with random encounters.
4. fight boss.

Items to be discovered are:
* healing potions.
* various weapons and shields.
* holy relics.
* gold
